        <h2>WHO ARE WE ? ? ?</h2>
        <P>  We are The women student welfare association  a premier female students body founded by the female students at the university of Nairobi in the year 1986 upon the realization that female students were being sidelined in the field of student leadership representation and advocacy. <br>

            These pre disposed students to various issues without a proper structure or reliable mechanism to seek redress. Such issues include but are not limited to: Sexual and reproductive health right by fellow students, the teaching faculty and administrative staff, Insecurity in and around the campus premises, Mental health and wellness concerns among others. <br>
            
            Upon this background, WOSWA was established to amplify the voices of female students and help provide a conducive environment for studies, mentorship and all rounded growth.  WOSWA therefore exists to; <br>
            1.	Feminize political spaces and advocacy channels. <br>
            2.	Provide platforms for mentorship and avenues for networking. <br>
            3.	Hone the leadership acumen and enterpreneurial skills of female students. <br>
            4.	Champion holistic health and wellness. <br>
            5.	Address any emergent issue that would touch on the overall affairs of students in campus. <br>
            WOSWA so far exists in 6 universities across the country including; university of Nairobi, Moi university, Kenyatta university, Alupe university college, Zetech university, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga university of science and technology. We are objective to open a new branch at the technical university of Mombasa upon continuous request by students. </P>

   </div>
   <p>As a women organization, we cannot ignore the issue os sexual gender based violence(SGBV) Being a student's body, we have no legal capacity to handle victim cases. We forward them to the school admin as well as other bodies that we liase with. <br> However, we have made great steps in advocacy against such cases and can proudly attest to a major decline.</p>
    <h6> 4 . Talent and skills Shaping</h6>
   <div class="skill">
    <img src="./teambuilding.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Talent and skills honing is also a major part of our organization. <br> Annually, we host thematic Miss WOSWA contests where girls get to model while promoting a particular motion. <br> It is mainly based on arising issues. The models also have to prove their ability to be WOSWA ambassadors through community services they have organized. <br> The crowned winners become the team leaders of promoting what beauty can do for the society</p>
    <p>Promoting skills. On this area, WOSWA seeks opportunities within and outside the institution to help the girls get more knowledge. <br> Trainings on different skills like SRHR advocacy, computer literacy programs, banking services to name but a few.</p>
